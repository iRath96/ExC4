## Introduction

This is an HTML5 messenger based on [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).

## Features

* Written in modern HTML5, CSS3 and JS
* Runs on Linux, OS X and Windows (more coming soon)
* Supports different kinds of notifications (sound notifications, visual notifications, OS-specific notifications)
* Channel-based, similiar to IRC, but flexible because plugins can be freely chosen for channels
* A wide variety of plugins is already provided (a chat-plugin or even games like Connect Four or Blackjack)
* Third-party plugins can be used to host channels, all you need is a host for your HTML-file

## Upcoming features

* Support for browsers and mobiles

* Several plugins planned (games/pool, utility/whiteboard, entertainment/watch-together, etc.)
